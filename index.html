<p> Currently a rising third year at the <a href="http://uchicago.edu">University Of Chicago</a> studying computer science and statistics.
	I started programming my first year in college (2012). I have gotten a lot better since then (hopefully you believe me). I enjoy building tools to maximize efficiency in any and all areas of life, and I tend to look towards data to explain what I don't understand. I love being challenged and learning new skills from other people. I hope that one day I can use my knowledge and abilities to help people. Until then, I am actively searching for an opportunity. If you have one <a href="contact.html">let me know.</a>
