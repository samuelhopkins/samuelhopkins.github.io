<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hey there, my name is Sam Hopkins. Or as some call me, Shopkins as per the domain name that got you here.
	I am a computer science and statistics major at the <a href="http://uchicago.edu">University Of Chicago</a>.
	I started programming my first year in college (2012). I was not very good at it. I have gotten a lot better at it since then (hopefully you believe me). I like to build tools to maximize efficiency in any and all areas of life. I like to analyze data to better understand the world, or just for fun. I love challenges and learning new skills from other people. I hope that one day I can use my knowledge and abilities to enrich people's lifes other than my own. Until then, I am actively searching for an opportunity. <a href="contact.html">Hit me up!</a>.

</p>
